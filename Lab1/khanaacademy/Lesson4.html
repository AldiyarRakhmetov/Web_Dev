    <h1>Great Big Words</h1>
    <h2>by Michael Mark & Tom Chapin</h2>
    <p>When I was a little kid,
    a "<em class="big">diminutive juvenile</em>," <br>
    I liked my folks to read to me,
    I was an <em class="big">"eager bibliophile."</em> <br>
    Now I love words for how they sound <br>
    And how they <em class="big">"communicate."</em> <br>
    Perhaps I should explain myself,
    that is, <em class="big">"elucidate."</em> <br>
    Great big words, I like <em class="big">big</em> words. <br>
    Letter by letter, the <em class="bigger">bigger</em> the better <br>
    Great big words. La la la la la la la la la la!</p>
